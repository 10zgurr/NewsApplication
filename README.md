I've used "Dagger2 Dependency Injection" and "Retrofit" libraries together to get and show data very efficiently way.
It's very useful on projects which has a big architecture.
You can see in the project how to use and basic rules of the Dagger2 library.
Also, how to use with Retrofit library and how to make calls.
Beside, I've used Android Data Binding for defining user interfaces more easy and simple way.

The libraries in the project are below:

* Dagger2 Dependency Injection
* Android Data Binding
* Retrofit
* OkHttp
* Picasso
* RecyclerView
* CardView
